# Ethereum Marketplace Dapp

### Final Project for Consensys Developer Program

I followed the recomendation and built an online marketplace.
It's incomplete since I didn't have the time to accomplish all the functionalities. I feel pretty bad about this actually. This last week was very difficult for me and I struggled a lot with some problems. :(

But you can test it anyway, and intereact with the smart contract.

###### How to get started:
* Clone the repo
* run npm install
* run Truffle compile
* run Truffle migrate

I've used this nice dashboard for the UI: https://github.com/BootstrapDash/StarAdmin-Free-Bootstrap-Admin-Template

###### What's missing and you would like to have it done 
* design_pattern_desicions.md
* avoiding_common_attacks.md
* Implement a library or an EthPM package
* Deploy your application onto the Rinkeby test network
* Integrate with an additional service (I'de like to use IPFS)
